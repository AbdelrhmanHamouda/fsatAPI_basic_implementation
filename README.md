# The main idea

A basic implementation of an API based on FastAPI.  
The main idea of this repo is to play around with the framework and get a feeling for what it can do.  
Following that, a new repo will be made to implement a more realistic API and deploy it.

### Takeaways
One of the more interesting aspects in this repo can be found in the "Modern_python_language_foundations".  
The use of the below aspects are highlighted:  
 - async/await
    - A way to make python scripts faster in cases where some time is spent on "waiting" for something to happen (e.g query for a database).
 - pydantic
    - Type checking made easy.
